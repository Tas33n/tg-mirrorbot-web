# tg-mirrorbot-web
A simple web script based on php, js.
simply upload this files in your hosting..

if you wanna use it just put your bot api key in index.php and server.php in line 3..

this script use telegram bot api to send file link in tg group that has mirror bot, 
then after the file get uploaded to gdrive, this script will get the file name and links from log channel/group and will show them to the visitors...

still need to improve the code, so if can improve it then u r most welcom..
